## Shentan: Chinese vocabulary sleuth

Anyone learning to read Chinese will tell you that it can be a slow-going experience. Learners read with the intent of expanding their vocabulary,
but encountering an unfamiliar word means a trip to a dictionary to look it up and memorize the pronunciation. A learner of Spanish may see the word _helado_,
infer from context that it means 'ice cream', and continue their reading uninterrupted. A learner of Chinese may encounter 冰淇淋 and conclude the same, but unless
they happen to know the readings of the component characters, they still have to stop and look it up. Great solutions to this problem like the [Zhongwen popup dictionary](
http://zhongwen-chrome.blogspot.com/) exist, but no tool can be a complete solution.

The shentan command line tool is easy to use:

	./shentan.py [num-characters-i-know] [source-file-or-url] [-q is for quiet]

I'll be expanding it soon to include things like flashcard exporting!

Shentan (神探) is Chinese for "master detective", and it usually refers to either literary figure Di Renjie (狄仁杰) or sometimes, Sherlock Holmes. In Chinese, he is 歇洛克.福尔摩斯, but that just doesn't have the same ring to it.
